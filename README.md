# M-M-Sorting-Machine

The objective of this project was to create a smart M&M sorter machine that could effectively separate M&M candies into their colors. In order to complete the project, a unique machine had to be constructed and designed using Solidworks CAD software for 3D-printed parts. Additionally, electrical and electronic components had to be integrated using Arduino microcontrollers and an ESP32 Cam module. Using the ESP32 Cam for color perception (under 200ms), the machine was built to show real-time data on an LCD display and separate M&M candies in a manner that is controlled by servo motors through a pipe system.
